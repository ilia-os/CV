### About

Computers are my life. I am interested in a wide range of topics: hardware architecture, operating systems, networking, front and back-end web development, effective databases, embedded systems and more. My hobby is to repair gadgets like phones and computers.

When I was studying in a school I self-learned basic python and attended programming courses. At that time I began using Linux as my primary OS.

Later I entered ITMO University where I was studying for two years. I learned a lot: Java, C, ASM, databases, build and test tools, version control systems, linux, patterns, abstractions, programming paradigms and doc reading.

After that I was working in a telecom company for about a year (remote). My job was to engineer optical fiber networks.

Now I am a full-stack developer and I'm looking for an enthusiastic team to learn from and deliver efficient and flexible software.
