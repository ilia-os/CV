### About

Computers are my life. I am interested in a wide range of topics: hardware architecture, operating systems, networking, front and back-end web development, effective databases, embedded systems and more. My hobby is to repair gadgets like phones and computers.

When I was studying in a school I self-learned basic python and attended programming courses. At that time I began using Linux as my primary OS.

Later I entered ITMO University where I was studying for two years as a software engineer. I learned a lot: Java, C, ASM, databases, build and test tools, version control systems, linux, patterns, abstractions, programming paradigms and doc reading.

Now I am a full-stack developer looking for an enthusiastic team to share knowledge and deliver efficient, flexible software.

I often do full-cycle development alone, so I do have experience in many areas related to producing software.

### Projects

* showshow - people-focused event discovery service powered by Rails, made just before corona kicked in. Featuring feeds, geo-aware search, subscriptions...
* several freestyle tilda website improvements (for example hooking up GMaps to validate delivery zones + zone editor for food delivery website). Not my idea
* warehouse - a really huge project for digitalizing internal warehouse operations with 1+ year of development and no QA. With the only developer leaving, my job was to refactor & implement missing backend features
* glazok - art project, my part was to create backend, admin panel and infrastructure
* hata.ai - a startup, where we wanted to parse flats-for-rent from major providers such as Avito & Cian, score them and deliver the best ones to our clients. I developed a multiservice architecture for our system, as well as most of its parts (model service, parser service, data service, communicating through kafka). Unfortunately, we were not able to beat major providers DDOS defence...
* [caravane.earth](https://caravane.earth) - vuejs website support. It features poor integration with some open-source block editor. With no prior QA and crazy code it was fun (though a bit painful) to fix it. Also, I was cleaning up and maintaining the infrastructure, set up a CD
* [venice.caravane.earth](https://venice.caravane.earth) - devops development support and small backend
* [heenatsalma.earth](https://heenatsalma.earth) - devops, rails backend development (mostly working on booking engine)
* foodMP - b2b marketplace for bulk selling edible products. I mostly did next.js frontend, also helped with express.js services with custom frameworks.. It had a major refactoring & redesign after MVP was achieved, with the new team. We also introduced new backend service written with nest.js to get rid of unstable main legacy service
* furnitureMP - fork of the foodMP project for another customer. b2b marketplace for selling furniture. We added interesting features like integration with the open source chat via websockets for customer support
* A couple simple mobile games made with godot
* Visual novel for mobile devices made with react. Featured a next.js-based interface for screenwriter with fully-interactive preview. This system then could bundle the code into cordova app and generate installable artifact (apk). The interesting thing was sharing the in-game code with the screenwriter interface
* bunch of corporate websites (for example, [inpositiv](https://inpositiv.com)). Commonly next.js + strapi. Featuring blog, careers and small slack integration
* [theissueof](https://staging.theissueof.com) - clothes store. Made with next.js on top of shopify using buy-sdk and custom convenient TS abstraction over it
* internal time tracking software - based on kimai2, heavily modified legacy application. I mostly did UI refactoring
