### About

Computers are my life. I am interested in a wide range of topics: hardware architecture, operating systems, networking, front and back-end web development, effective databases, embedded systems and more. My hobby is to repair gadgets like phones and computers.

When I was studying in a school I self-learned basic python and attended programming courses. At that time I began using Linux as my primary OS.

Later I entered ITMO University where I was studying for two years. I learned a lot: Java, C, ASM, databases, build and test tools, version control systems, linux, patterns, abstractions, programming paradigms and doc reading.

After that I was working in a telecom company for about a year (remote). My job was to engineer optical fiber networks.

While I was working I began to study Ruby on Rails and related tools.
Later my dream came true and I finally began working as a developer.

My first project was an event-focused website, development of which was paused because of corona. Customer was a designer, and I did everything related to code and infrastructure.
The stack was: RoR, ActiveJob (sidekiq), Turbolinks, devise, PostgreSQL, S3, nginx (passenger), slim, SCSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, React.js, Webpack, Capistrano. 

Later I was working on an ML project in a bigger team of developers. We wanted to score flats-for-rent from real estate aggregators like Cian and Avito and provide the best ones to our customers. My job was to tie together all the components: data-retrieval service working through Kafka, parser, model, data storage and front-end. I designed the internal APIs and services interaction (I love making diagrams). I also wrote a lot of python code for an HTML parser and model wrapper. API (RoR, ruby-kafka, JWT authorization, ActiveJob (sidekiq), PostgreSQL, S3, Capistrano) was ready, but the development stalled because of aggregator's DDOS defense, which we believed we could handle.

Now I mostly work in a freelance style and improving various existing websites. I'm looking for an enthusiastic team to learn from and deliver efficient and flexible software.
