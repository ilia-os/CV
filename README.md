Enforced programming best practices to ensure code quality and maintainability throughout the project. Pushed infrastructure improvements, streamlining the development process and enhancing deployment efficiency. Successfully implemented a versatile "theme" system to provide customized marketplace frontends. Integrated with third-party systems including Shopify, WooCommerce, and Advarics to enhance functionality. Achieved efficiency by reusing the web codebase for a full-featured mobile app, resulting in a rapid release to the App Store within two weeks. Overcame significant legacy challenges, particularly with the backend system, to ensure the project's success.

* Visual novel for mobile devices made with react. Featured a next.js-based interface for screenwriter with fully-interactive preview. This system then could bundle the code into cordova app and generate installable artifact (apk). The interesting thing was sharing the in-game code with the screenwriter interface
