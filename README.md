### About

Computers are my life. I am interested in a wide range of topics: hardware architecture, operating systems, networking, front and back-end web development, effective databases, embedded systems and more. My hobby is to repair gadgets like phones and computers.

When I was studying in a school I self-learned basic python and attended programming courses. At that time I began using Linux as my primary OS.

Later I entered ITMO University where I was studying for two years. I learned a lot: Java, C, ASM, databases, build and test tools, version control systems, linux, patterns, abstractions, programming paradigms and doc reading.

Now I am a full-stack developer looking for an enthusiastic team to share knowledge and deliver efficient and flexible software.

I often do full-cycle development alone, so I do have experience in many areas related to producing software.

Experince working in a team as regular and lead developer.

### Projects

* showshow - people-focused event catalog (similar to timepad) powered by Rails, made just before corona kicked in. Featuring feeds, geo-aware search, subscriptions...
* several freestyle tilda website improvements (for example hooking up GMaps to validate delivery zones + zone editor for food delivery website). Not my idea
* warehouse - a really huge project for digitalizing internal warehouse operations with 1+ year of development and no QA. With the only developer leaving, my job was to refactor & implement missing backend features
* glazok - art project, my part was to create backend, admin panel and infrastructure
* hata.ai - a startup, where we wanted to parse flats-for-rent from major providers such as Avito & Cian, score them and deliver the best ones to our clients. I developed a multiservice architecture for our system, as well as most of its parts (model service, parser service, data service, communicating through kafka). Unfortunately, we were not able to beat major providers DDOS defence...
* [caravane.earth](https://caravane.earth) - vuejs website support. It features poor integration with some open-source block editor. With no prior QA and crazy code it was fun (though a bit painful) to fix it. Also, I was cleaning up infrastructure and building up a CD
* [venice.caravane.earth](https://venice.caravane.earth) - mostly devops things & rails configuration for frontend developer
* [heenatsalma.earth](https://heenatsalma.earth) - devops things, rails backend development (mostly working on booking engine)
* foodMP - b2b marketplace for bulk selling edible products. Mostly did next.js frontend, also helped with express.js services with custom frameworks (not sane). It had a major refactoring & redesign after MVP was achieved, with the new team. The moment I fell in love with TS, docker and monorepos. We also introduced new backend service written with nest.js to get rid of unstable main legacy service
* furnitureMP - fork of the yello project for another customer. b2b marketplace for selling furniture. I'd like to note RocketChat integration through websocket interface implemented by me
* godot game (parking escape clone)
* visual novel for mobile devices made with react. Featured a next.js-based interface for screenwriter with fully-interactive preview. This system then could bundle the code into cordova app and generate installable artifact (apk). This way we shared the in-game code with the editor
* bunch of corporate websites (for example, [inpositiv](https://inpositiv.com)). Commonly next.js + strapi. Featuring blog, careers and small slack integration
* [theissueof](https://staging.theissueof.com) - clothes store. Made on top of shopify using buy-sdk and custom convenient TS abstraction over it
* internal time tracking software - based on kimai2, heavily modified application with separate frontend written with next.js
