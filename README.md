### Projects

* showshow - people-focused event discovery service powered by Rails, made just before corona kicked in. Featuring feeds, geo-aware search, subscriptions... Solo development
* several freestyle tilda website improvements (for example hooking up GMaps to validate delivery zones + zone editor for food delivery website)
* warehouse - big project for digitalizing internal warehouse operations with 1+ year of development and no QA. With the only developer leaving, my job was to implement missing backend features
* glazok - art project, my part was to create backend, admin panel and infrastructure
* hata.ai - a startup, where we wanted to parse flats-for-rent from major providers such as Avito & Cian, score them and deliver the best ones to our clients. I developed a multiservice architecture for our system, as well as most of its parts (model service, parser service, data service, communicating through kafka). Unfortunately, we were not able to beat major providers DDOS defence and the project had stall without the data.
* [caravane.earth](https://caravane.earth) - vuejs website support. It features poor integration with some open-source block editor. With no prior QA and crazy code it was fun (though a bit painful) to fix it. Also, I was cleaning up and maintaining the infrastructure, set up a CD
* [venice.caravane.earth](https://venice.caravane.earth) - devops development support and small backend
* [heenatsalma.earth](https://heenatsalma.earth) - devops, rails backend development (mostly working on booking engine)
* foodMP - b2b marketplace for bulk selling edible products. I mostly did next.js frontend, also helped with express.js services with custom frameworks.. It had a major refactoring & redesign after MVP was achieved, with the new team. We also introduced new backend service written with nest.js to get rid of unstable main legacy service
* furnitureMP - fork of the foodMP project for another customer. b2b marketplace for selling furniture. We added interesting features like integration with the open source chat via websockets for customer support
* A couple simple mobile games made with godot
* Visual novel for mobile devices made with react. Featured a next.js-based interface for screenwriter with fully-interactive preview. This system then could bundle the code into cordova app and generate installable artifact (apk). The interesting thing was sharing the in-game code with the screenwriter interface
* bunch of corporate websites (for example, [inpositiv](https://inpositiv.com), [cogify](https://cogify.io)). Commonly next.js + strapi. Featuring blog, careers and small slack integration
* [theissueof](https://staging.theissueof.com) - Independently developed an online clothing store using Next.js on top of Shopify, employing the Shopify Buy SDK and crafting a custom TypeScript abstraction for enhanced dev experience. Took on the challenge solo, bringing to life a sleek and functional platform for browsing and purchasing clothing items. Utilizing a blend of technical expertise and creativity, I ensured a seamless and convenient shopping experience for users while maintaining simplicity and efficiency in the development process.
* [organitz](https://organitz.com) - Played a pivotal role in the modernization efforts of a legacy PHP project, originally derived from an open-source project. Led the overhaul of the user interface for improved usability and aesthetics, while also taking charge of architecting discussions and spearheading the development of a companion mobile app. Navigated through substantial legacy constraints and successfully revitalized the web interface, delivering enhanced user experiences and positioning the application for future growth.
* [xplusone.app](xplusone.app) -  Led a dev team in the development of a multitenant ([example tenant](https://veletage.com)) marketplace SaaS platform, delivering custom marketplace solutions for each tenant. Enforced programming best practices to ensure code quality and maintainability throughout the project. Pushed infrastructure improvements, streamlining the development process and enhancing deployment efficiency. Successfully implemented a versatile "theme" system to provide customized marketplace frontends. Integrated with third-party systems including Shopify, WooCommerce, and Advarics to enhance functionality. Achieved efficiency by reusing the web codebase for a full-featured mobile app, resulting in a rapid release to the App Store within two weeks. Overcame significant legacy challenges, particularly with the backend system, to ensure the project's success.
